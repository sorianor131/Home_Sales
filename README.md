# Home_Sales
Module 22 Homework Assignment - Big Data Challenge

## Challenge
In this challenge, we were tasked with using our knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. We would then use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

## Questions to Answer
The following questions were to be answered using SparkSQL:

1. What is the average price for a four bedroom house sold in each year rounded to two decimal places?
#### Result:

2. What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built that have 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms rounded to two decimal places?
#### Result:
